**Author**: Toby!  
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This is the root repository for all the data structure and algorithm realated content.  

For first week:
Day2: We have array_shift, where we want to insert an integer into the middle position of an array  
(more detail please see the branch readme.md)


## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
in Terminal, go to the directory, and then type in to run the code in python.


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
This main code is written in python 3.6 with all default functions (no library import required.)  
The test code is realized by using pytest  



## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
No API available right now.
