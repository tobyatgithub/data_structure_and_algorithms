# FizzBuzz Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
In this file, we write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument. Without utilizing any
of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible
by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The main challenge here is to keep the change inplace during traverse, and take care of
invalid data inputs.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The Big O time will be O(n) as we only traverse through each data point once.
The Big O space will be O(1) as we only modify pointers and don't create any new data.
