# Breadth-first
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A function that takes a binary tree as input, and perform breadth first traversal,
print the process as the result or ouput of the function.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge here is breadth first. The trick here is using a queue.
Recursion won't do much good over here.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O time for this is O(n) since we only traverse every data point once.
Big O space for this is O(max width of any level) as we only use a 'queue' and store all point in each leavel in it at any one loop.
