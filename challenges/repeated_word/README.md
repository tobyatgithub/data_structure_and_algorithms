# Implement a Find first repeated word via Hash Table.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. input check and pre-process.
2. translate input string into a format such that can be hashed.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The space big O is constant O(n) as we just save the input string into hash table once.
The time big O is O(n) as the get method from hash table is close to 1.
